Parameterization by reading the inputs from an Excel and parse it to an object array within a method annotated as @DataProvider



1. Excel sheet with the data accomodated.
2. We need to create a generic class with the methods that can read the data from Excel.

1. Open the file in an input mode / read mode --> FileInputStream (Java.io)
2. Should be recognized as Excel work book --> APACHE Poi --> XSSFWorkbook
3. Should reach specific sheet(id /name) --> Apache poi --> XSSFSheet
4. Reach row
5. reach cell
6. read the data with in a cell in the string format


3. The data should be feeded into the Object[][] under the @DataProvider method

ExtentReports is an API used along with Selenium & TestNG.

ExtentReport is expected to listen / read the test results generated by the TestNG and create a separate HTML report that can be customizable.

1. Create the HTML format
2. can be customizable, can represent the test resuts in the pie graph.
3. capture the screeshots for all the failed test and attach that in the HTML report.


1. Generic class Reporting that extends TestListnerAdapter

1. method where we can configure the ExtentReport  template in the HTML forma
2. the reports to automativcally loaded into Reports folder in the project.
3. We need have a new report create upon every execution.
